# Natural Language Processing Assignments

The two projects were developed to fulfill the two assignments required for the Natural Language Processing course in the Master's Degree in Artificial Intelligence at the University of Bologna.

## Assignment 1

### Abstract
This study conducts a comparative analysis of some RNN architectures in the context of Part-Of-Speech (POS) tagging, to investigate their performance. Specifically, we focused on architectures composed of Bidirectional LSTMs and dense layer(s) on top. We observed the model composed of a 2-layer Bidirectional LSTM and a dense layer to perform best among those in the analysis, reaching a macro F1 score of 0.8267 in the validation set and of 0.83524 in the test set.

### Description
For a detailed explanation of the project, please refer to [the report](https://github.com/alessandrablasioli/NLP/blob/main/A1/report.pdf).

### Usage
To utilize this project, follow these steps:

1. **Download the Repository:**
   Clone or download the repository to your local machine using the following command:

        git clone https://github.com/alessandrablasioli/NLP.git

2. **Navigate to the Directory:**
   Open a terminal or command prompt and move into the downloaded directory:

        cd /A1

3. **Run the Notebook:**
   Execute the Jupyter Notebook named `A1.ipynb` by running:

        jupyter notebook A1.ipynb

This will open the notebook in your default web browser, allowing you to view and interact with the code.

## Assignment 2

### Abstract
This study compares different model architectures for human values detection in textual arguments. Specifically, we focused on predicting higher-order values using BERT-based architectures with a classification head on top. Using all the components of textual arguments led to better results, reaching a macro F1 score of 0.74 on the validation set and 0.72 on the test set.
